# 🌍 Climate Change Modeling: Sea Level Prediction

This project aims to model and predict sea level changes using historical climate data. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly polynomial regression, we explore how factors like CO₂ emissions and solar radiation influence sea levels. This can help in understanding long-term climate trends and performing scenario analysis for informed planning and mitigation.

## 📊 Project Overview

Climate change is an urgent global issue with far-reaching impacts. One of the most visible consequences is rising sea levels, driven by melting glaciers, thermal expansion, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.

This project:

* Analyzes historical climate data (1989–2017)
* Predicts future sea level rise
* Conducts **scenario analysis** using different CO₂ emission trajectories

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset includes **348 monthly entries** (1989–2017) with the following features:

| Feature                              | Description                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Day`                                | Mid-month timestamp                        |
| `Avg Min Temperature (°C)`           | Average minimum monthly temperature        |
| `Avg Max Temperature (°C)`           | Average maximum monthly temperature        |
| `Radiation amount (kWh/m²/day)`      | Solar radiation received per square meter  |
| `gas_emission (billion metric tons)` | Global CO₂ emissions                       |
| `Sea level (mm)`                     | Monthly sea level deviation in millimeters |

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Combined and interpolated multiple datasets
   * Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., unnamed index)
   * Converted yearly data into monthly format for uniformity

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Trend analysis for all variables
   * Correlation matrix to assess relationships between variables

3. **Modeling**

   * Tried multiple regression models:

     * Linear Regression
     * Random Forest
     * Polynomial Regression (best performance: **MSE \~ 4.97**, **R² \~ 0.86**)

4. **Future Projections**

   * Predicted sea levels for 2018–2030 using polynomial regression

5. **Scenario Analysis**

   * Simulated different emission scenarios:

     * Low Emission
     * Medium Emission
     * High Emission
   * Assessed impact of each on projected sea levels

---

## 📈 Results

* **Polynomial Regression** outperformed other models with the lowest MSE and highest R² score.
* Visualization of actual vs. predicted values showed strong alignment.
* Scenario analysis revealed that higher emissions could accelerate sea level rise.
